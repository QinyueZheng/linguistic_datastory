Everyone communicates with other people. Most of the time, the conversations will have happy endings. But sometimes, the conversations maybe go awry. This kind of conversations gone awry are more often on the internet. Due to the anonymity, online conversations are notorious for simple misunderstandings, personal attacks and antisocial behaviors.

Suppose you are a peace-loving linguist, and what you cannot tolerate are personal attacks, whether it is physical or verbal. One day, you are browsing the Wikipedia, and you find some entries should be modified or corrected. So you make some comments on the Wikipedia talk page. However, some other editors do not agree with your changes, and deny your suggestions. Hence you have a conversation with them:

    <br>
    <div style="color:orange;
        display: inline-block;
        color: #999;
        padding: 2px;">Your conversation with the editors.</div>

Wow, this is so implite. This is **personal attack**!! As a linguist, you come up with a brilliant idea: can we detect such kind of unfriendly conversations on the internet automatically? Further more, is there any linguistic cues that we can use to predict whether the conversation will go awry before it actually happens?

Let's try to utilize a linguistic dataset to analyze this hypothesis. Here we are going to use the **Conversations Gone Awry Dataset**, which is a collection of conversations among Wikipedia editors from Wikipedia talk pages. In the dataset, some of the conversations will derail into personal attacks.

## Dataset Observation
Let's have a closer look at this dataset. 

Some statistics about the dataset?
